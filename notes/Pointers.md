# Pointers

syntax: int *ptr = &age;

The name of the pointer is ptr and it has some address and it stores the address of anotehr one. to deference it, you can use *ptr = ...

you can do *(struct_ptr).field or struct_ptr->field which is often simpler.

All pointers are the same size because all of them say the address.

# Arrays

They are stored in contiguous memory like Struct.

# String methods

stringlen -> it copies the second parameter to the end of the first parameter.
strlen -> this will give you the length of the string
